**Application Description:**
***A vending machine Simulator***.
 A vending machine is a common example of a stateful system, as its behavior changes based on its current state and the actions performed by the user.

**State Design Pattern Implementation:**
In the code, I implemented the State design pattern to model the behavior of the vending machine. Here's how the pattern was implemented:

1. **VendingMachineContext:** This class acts as the context for the vending machine. It holds a reference to the current state of the vending machine and delegates actions to the current state object.

2. **VendingMachineState:** This interface defines the contract for all concrete state classes. It declares methods like `insertCoin()`, `selectItem()`, and `dispenseItem()`, which represent the actions that can be performed on the vending machine.

3. **Concrete State Classes:**
   - **AcceptingCoinsState:** Represents the state where the vending machine is ready to accept coins.
   - **IdleState:** Represents the initial state of the vending machine.
   - **SelectingItemState:** Represents the state where the user has selected an item.
   - **DispensingItemState:** Represents the state where the vending machine is dispensing the selected item.

Each concrete state class implements the methods defined in the `VendingMachineState` interface to specify its behavior. For example, in the `AcceptingCoinsState`, only the `insertCoin()` method is allowed, while in the `SelectingItemState`, the `selectItem()` method is allowed.

**How the State Design Pattern is Utilized:**
- The State design pattern allows our vending machine to change its behavior dynamically based on its current state and the actions performed by the user.

- By encapsulating the behavior of each state in separate classes, we achieve better modularity and maintainability of the code.
- The context class (`VendingMachineContext`) delegates the actions to the current state object, allowing for seamless transitions between states without complex conditional statements.
